If presented word has more than two possible correct translations, compute levenshtein distance between presented word and the typed correct response:
* porc-pork instead of porc-pig is considered valid
* porc-puerco instead of porc-cerdo is considered valid
* bol-cuenco instead of bol-bol is considered valid
* bou-toro instead of bou-buey is considered valid
* fulla-folio instead of fulla-hoja is considered valid
* globos-globus instead of globus-globo is considered valid
Morphological inflexions (e.g., gender, plurar) of correct translations are considered valid
Trials in which the word "corona" was presented were excluded because of its newly acquired meaning during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Typos are considered correct responses. Responses are considered typos if they are only one edit distance apart from the correct translation (insertion, deletion, substitution, or transposition), not counting omission of diacritic accents, only if they are not real words
If participants responds more than 20% of trials with a word from a language other than the target one, all their responses are excluded
Abbreviations of the correct translation (e.g., bici instead of bicicleta) are considered correct
