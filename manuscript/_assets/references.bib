  abstract = {Eye movements to pictures of four objects on a screen were monitored as participants followed a spoken instruction to move one of the objects, e.g., “Pick up the beaker; now put it below the diamond” (Experiment 1) or heard progressively larger gates and tried to identify the referent (Experiment 2). The distractor objects included a cohort competitor with a name that began with the same onset and vowel as the name of the target object (e.g.,beetle), a rhyme competitor (e.g.speaker), and an unrelated competitor (e.g.,carriage). In Experiment 1, there was clear evidence for both cohort and rhyme activation as predicted by continuous mapping models such as TRACE (McClelland and Elman, 1986) and Shortlist (Norris, 1994). Additionally, the time course and probabilities of eye movements closely corresponded to response probabilities derived from TRACE simulations using the Luce choice rule (Luce, 1959). In the gating task, which emphasizes word-initial information, there was clear evidence for multiple activation of cohort members, as measured by judgments and eye movements, but no suggestion of rhyme effects. Given that the same sets of pictures were present during the gating task as in Experiment 1, we conclude that the rhyme effects in Experiment 1 were not an artifact of using a small set of visible alternatives.},

In addition, it includes a wider range of TV shows (e.g., news, documentaries, debates, and talk shows) than has been included in most previous databases. Frequency metrics were obtained for the whole corpus, on the one hand, and only for films and fiction TV series, on the other. Two lexical decision experiments revealed that the subtitle-based metrics outperformed the previously available frequency estimates, computed from either written texts or texts from the Internet. Furthermore, the metrics obtained from the whole corpus were better predictors than the ones obtained from films and fiction TV series alone. In both experiments, the best predictor of response times and accuracy was contextual diversity.},

Word frequency measures should be based on a corpus of at least 20 million words that contains language participants in psychology experiments are likely to have been exposed to. In addition, the quality of word frequency measures should be ascertained by correlating them with behavioral word processing data. When we apply these criteria to the word frequency measures available for the German language, we find that the commonly used Celex frequencies are the least powerful to predict lexical decision times. Better results are obtained with the Leipzig frequencies, the dlexDB frequencies, and the Google Books 2000-2009 frequencies. However, as in other languages the best performance is observed with subtitle-based word frequencies. The SUBTLEX-DE word frequencies collected for the present ms are made available in easy-to-use files and are free for educational purposes.},

  abstract = {Languages differ in the constitution of their phonemic repertoire and in the relative distinctiveness of phonemes within the repertoire. In the present study, we asked whether such differences constrain spoken-word recognition, via two word reconstruction experiments, in which listeners turned nonwords into real words by changing single sounds. The experiments were carried out in Dutch (which has a relatively balanced vowel—consonant ratio and many similar vowels) and in Spanish (which has many more consonants than vowels and high distinctiveness among the vowels). Both Dutch and Spanish listeners responded significantly faster and more accurately when required to change vowels as opposed to consonants; when allowed to change any phoneme, they more often altered vowels than consonants. Vowel information thus appears to constrain lexical selection less tightly (allow more potential candidates) than does consonant information, independent of language-specific phoneme repertoire and of relative distinctiveness of vowels.},

Statistical NLP methods determine the likelihood of a word combination from its frequency in a training corpus. However, the nature of language is such that many word combinations are infrequent and do not occur in any given corpus. In this work we propose a method for estimating the probability of such previously unseen word combinations using available information on “most similar” words.},

According to Brysbaert and Duyck (2010), a strong need is felt for a unified implemented account of bilingual word comprehension, lexical-semantic processing, and word production. With this goal in mind, we built a localist-connectionist model, called Multilink, which integrates basic assumptions of both BIA+ and RHM. It simulates the recognition and production of cognates (form-similar translation equivalents) and non-cognates of different lengths and frequencies in tasks like monolingual and bilingual lexical decision, word naming, and word translation production. It also considers effects of lexical similarity, cognate status, relative L2-proficiency, and translation direction. Model-to-model comparisons show that Multilink provides higher correlations with empirical data than both IA and BIA+ models.},

The integration of partial cues to phonological identity is examined, showing that the model provides a sound basis for simulating phonetic and lexical decision data from W. Marslen-Wilson and P. Warren (1994). The time course of lexical access is also investigated, and it is argued that the process of competition between word candidates during lexical access can be interpreted in terms of interference between distributed lexical representations. The relation between this model and other models of spoken word recognition is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

In Experiment 1, priming with low frequency, phonetically related spoken words inhibited target recognition, as predicted by the Neighborhood Activation Model. In Experiment 2, the same prime-target pairs were presented with a longer inter-stimulus interval and the effects of priming were eliminated. In both experiments, predictions derived from the Neighborhood Activation Model regarding the effects of neighborhood density and word frequency were supported. The results are discussed in terms of competing activation of lexical neighbors and the dissociation of activation and frequency in spoken word recognition.},

Each word was presented repeatedly, and its presentation time (duration from the onset of the word) increased at each successive pass. After each pass, subjects were asked to write down the word being presented and to indicate how confident they were about each guess. In addition to replicating a frequency, a context, and a word-length effect, this “gating” paradigm allowed us to study more closely the narrowing-in process employed by listeners in the isolation and recognition of words: Some delay appears to exist between the moment a word is isolated from other word candidates and the moment it is recognized; word candidates differ in number and in type from one context to the other; and, like syntactic processing, word recognition is strewn with garden paths. The active direct access model proposed by Marslen-Wilson and Welsh is discussed in light of these findings.},

The isolation points and total acceptance points were calculated with respect to the acoustic offsets of the words. It was found that more than half of the monosyllabic words were isolatedafter their offset, and thatall these words, with one exception, received a perfect confidence rating during the next word or words.

The listener's dependence on bottom-up analyses in the shadowing task, as measured by the number of fluent restorations of mispronounced words, was found to vary as a function of the syllable position of the mispronunciation within the word and of the contextual constraints on the word as a whole. In the detection task only syllable position effects were obtained. The results, discussed in conjunction with earlier research, were found to be inconsistent with either the logogen model of word-recognition or an autonomous search model. Instead, an active direct access model is proposed, in which top-down processing constraints interact directly with bottom-up information to produce the primary lexical interpretation of the acoustic-phonetic input.},

Both experiments used three word-monitoring tasks, which varied the description under which the word-target was monitored for (phonetic, semantic, or both) and three different prose contexts (normal, semantically anomalous, and scrambled), as well as distributing word-targets across nine word-positions in the test-sentences. The presence or absence of a context sentence, varied across the two experiments, allowed an estimate of between-sentence effects on local and global processes. The combined results, presenting a detailed picture of the temporal structuring of these various processes, provided evidence for an on-line interactive language processing theory, in which lexical, structural (syntactic), and interpretative knowledge sources communicate and interact during processing in an optimally efficient and accurate manner. Résumé On présente deux expériences faites pour étudier la compréhension du langage parlé en fonction du parcours temporel dans la chaîne. La recherche a porté à la fois sur les processus (locaux) de reconnaissance des mots et sur les processus structuraux et interprétatifs (globaux). Dans chacune des expériences on a utilisé trois tâches de détection de mots. Ces tâches se distinguaient par la qualification sous laquelle le mot á détecter était décrit (phonétique, sémantique oú les deux) et par trois contextes différents (normal, sémantiquement anormal oú brouillé). D'autre part les mots cibles se distribuaient selon neuf positions dans les phrase-tests. La présence oú l'absence d'un contexte phrastique permettait une estimation des effects inter-phrases sur les processus locaux et globaux. L'ensemble des résultats donnent une image détaillé de la structuration temporelle des différents processus. L'hypothése d'un calcul du langage interactif en temps réel est favorisée. Selon cette hypothése, durant le traitement, les diverses sources de connaissance, lexicales, structurales (syntaxiques) et interprétatives communiquent et interagissent d'une façon maximalement précise et efficace.},

The first and third words of each triplet were related to one, both, or neither meaning of the second word which was semantically ambiguous. The performance pattern of the Wernicke's aphasics was similar to that of normals. They showed selective access to different meanings of the ambiguous words, as demonstrated by the fact that the context provided by the first word affected semantic facilitation on the third word. In contrast, Broca's aphasics showed no semantic facilitation in any priming condition. These results are consistent with previous findings, suggesting that semantic representations may be largely spared in Wernicke's aphasics. The failure of the Broca's aphasics to demonstrate facilitation is consistent with the view that they have a processing deficit in automatically accessing the lexical representation of words.},

Tests involved phonetically different words (e.g. [pize] vs. [mora], Experiment 1), words differing minimally on their onset consonant (e.g. [pize] vs. [tize], Experiment 2a), and conditions which had never been tested before: non-initial consonantal contrasts (e.g. [pide] vs. [pige], Experiment 2b), and vocalic contrasts (e.g. [pize] vs. [pyze]; [pize] vs. [paze]; [pize] vs. [pizu], Experiments 3a–c). Results differed across conditions: words could be easily learnt in the phonetically different condition, and were learnt, though to a lesser degree, in both the initial and non-initial minimal consonant contrast; however, infants' global performance on all three vocalic contrasts was at chance level. The present results shed new light regarding the specificity of early words, and raise the possibility of different contributions for vowels and consonants in early word learning.},

This finding poses theoretical problems for strictly hierarchical models of speech recognition, in which smaller units should be able to be identified faster than larger units. However, inspection of the characteristics of previous experiments’ stimuli reveals that subjects have been able to respond to syllables on the basis of only a partial analysis of the stimulus. In the present experiment, five groups of subjects listened to identical stimulus material. Phoneme and syllable monitoring under standard conditions was compared with monitoring under conditions in which near matches of target and stimulus occurred on no-response trials. In the latter case, when subjects were forced to analyze each stimulus fully, phonemes were detected faster than syllables.},

The authors present data and simulations that suggest that this ability is best accounted for by a model of spoken-word recognition combining competition between alternative lexical candidates, and sensitivity to prosodic structure. In a word-spotting experiment, stress pattern effects emerged most clearly when there were many competing lexical candidates for part of the input. Thus, competition between simultaneously active word candidates can modulate the size of prosodic effects, which suggests that spoken-word recognition must be sensitive both to prosodic structure and to the effects of competition. A version of the Shortlist model (D. G. Norris, 1994b) incorporating the Metrical Segmentation Strategy (A. Cutler \& D. Norris, 1988) accurately simulates the results using a lexicon of more than 25,000 words.},

  abstract = {During speech comprehension, bilinguals co-activate both of their languages, resulting in cross-linguistic interaction at various levels of processing. This interaction has important consequences for both the structure of the language system and the mechanisms by which the system processes spoken language. Using computational modeling, we can examine how cross-linguistic interaction affects language processing in a controlled, simulated environment. Here we present a connectionist model of bilingual language processing, the Bilingual Language Interaction Network for Comprehension of Speech (BLINCS), wherein interconnected levels of processing are created using dynamic, self-organizing maps. BLINCS can account for a variety of psycholinguistic phenomena, including cross-linguistic interaction at and across multiple levels of processing, cognate facilitation effects, and audio-visual integration during speech comprehension. The model also provides a way to separate two languages without requiring a global language-identification system. We conclude that BLINCS serves as a promising new model of bilingual spoken language comprehension.},

We used a priming technique to test specific predictions regarding cohort activation in three experiments. In each experiment, subjects identified target words embedded in noise at different signal-to-noise ratios. The target words were either presented in isolation or preceded by a prime item that shared phonological information with the target. In Experiment 1, primes and targets were English words that shared zero, one, two, three, or all phonemes from the beginning of the word. In Experiment 2, nonword primes preceded word targets and shared initial phonemes. In Experiment 3, word primes and word targets shared phonemes from the end of a word. Evidence of reliable phonological priming was observed in all three experiments. The results of the first two experiments support the assumption of activation of lexical candidates based on word-initial information, as proposed in cohort theory. However, the results of the third experiment, which showed increased probability of correctly identifying targets that shared phonemes from the end of words, did not support the predictions derived from the theory. The findings are discussed in terms of current models of auditory word recognition and recent approaches to spoken-language understanding.},

  abstract = {The comprehension of speech is clearly an integrative process. In fact, such a statement seems so self-evident as to be nearly tautologous; to understand an utterance we must, in some fashion, retrieve information about the words in that utterance, discover the structural relationship and semantic properties of those words, and interpret these in the light of the various pragmatic and discourse constraints operating at the time. Further, all of this takes place at a remarkably rapid pace, a fact (among several others) that has led a number of theorists to characterize the comprehension system in general as being a contextually determined or "top down " process, a system that allows all temporally previous information to affect the analysis of new information at any point in its procesing, thus providing maximally rapid processing and interpretation of new sensory information. Some im-pressive empirical work demonstrating the very rapid effects of certain "higher " order information sources upon the processing of "lower " order information has recently provided some important substantiation for this position (see, in particular, Marslen-Wilson \& Tyler, 1980). To a great extent, such interactionist points of view have developed in response to the limitations of a particular model of speech understanding, one derived from a rigid mapping of Transformational Generative Gram-mar onto a putative comprehension system. Under this particular system, comprehension is viewed as being composed of a series of serially en-countered, hierarchically organized autonomous processing modules (see Marslen-Wilson, 1976, and Tyler, 1982, for excellent detailed discussions of these approaches). The goal of this paper is to examine both the interactionist and},

These responses, pooled across subjects, enabled us to evaluate a number of claims concerning the use of top-down and bottom-up information in the process of word recognition. The analyses show that, in the process of recognizing a spoken word, subjects initially produce a large number of responses compatible with the sensory input. This set diminishes in size as more of the word is presented. The rate at which responses drop out of the initial set differs, depending on whether words are heard in isolation or in context. These properties of the elicited responses are compatible with claims made by the cohort model for the integration of top-down and bottom-up information in the process of recognizing a spoken word.},

First, an analysis of data from a series of word-spotting experiments is presented suggesting that listeners treat vowels as more mutable than consonants in auditory word recognition in English. In order to assess this hypothesis, a word reconstruction task was devised in which listeners were required to turn word-like nonwords into words by adapting the identity of either one vowel or one consonant. Listeners modified vowel identity more readily than consonant identity. Furthermore, incorrect responses more often involved a vowel change than a consonant change. These findings are compatible with the proposal that English listeners are equipped to deal with vowel variability by assuming that vowel identity is comparatively underdefined. The results are discussed in the light of theoretical accounts of speech processing.},

  abstract = {Recent work (Vitevitch \& Luce, 1998) investigating the role of phonotactic information in spoken word recognition suggests the operation of two levels of representation, each having distinctly different consequences for processing. The lexical level is marked by competitive effects associated with similarity neighborhood activation, whereas increased probabilities of segments and sequences of segments facilitate processing at the sublexical level. We investigated the two proposed levels in six experiments using monosyllabic and specially constructed bisyllabic words and nonwords. The results of these studies provide further support for the hypothesis that the processing of spoken stimuli is a function of both facilitatory effects associated with increased phonotactic probabilities and competitive effects associated with the activation of similarity neighborhoods. We interpret these findings in the context of Grossberg, Boardman, and Cohen's (1997) adaptive resonance theory of speech perception.},
